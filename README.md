# Portfolio (Responsive)

This is a mobileâ€‘first, responsive portfolio starter built with semantic HTML, modern CSS (Flexbox/Grid), and a tiny bit of JS for the mobile nav.

## How to use
1. Edit `index.html` content (text, links).
2. Adjust colors in `styles.css` if you want to change the theme.
3. Add project screenshots to `/assets` and link them in the Projects section.
4. Test locally by opening `index.html` in your browser.
5. Deploy by pushing to a GitHub repo and enabling GitHub Pages (branch: `main`, folder: `/root`).

## Accessibility
- Skip link, semantic landmarks, accessible nav toggle, and sufficient color contrast.
- Keyboard friendly.

## Performance
- No frameworks, minimal JS, system fonts (Inter), and CSS only layout = very fast.

You own this. Do whatever you like.
